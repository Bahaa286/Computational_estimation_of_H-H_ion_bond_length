# Computational_estimation_of_H-H_ion_bond_length
Computational estimation of H-H ion bond length is a numerical solution code used to determine the hydrogen molecule ion bond length by using variational principle in quantum mechanics. The variational principle had been used to reach to the position potential relation and the minumum value had been determined numerically.
The c++ code file used to calculate the minumum value and export the function plot data to .txt file. Then the python file import the data to plot them.
