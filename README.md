# Computational_estimation_of_H-H_ion_bond_length
Computational estimation of H-H ion bond length is a numerical solution code used to determine the hydrogen molecule ion bond length by using variational principle in quantum mechanics. The variational principle had been used to reach to the position potential relation and the minumum value had been determined numerically.
